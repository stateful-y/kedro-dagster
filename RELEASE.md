# Release 0.4.0

## Major features and improvements
- Wrap all Dagster `dg` CLI commands to be run from within a Kedro project with `kedro dagster <dg command>` by @gtauzin.
- Add a `kedro_dagster.logging` module meant to replace `logging` imports in Kedro nodes so loggers are captured and integrated with Dagster by @gtauzin.
- Add `loggers` section to `dagster.yml` configuration file to configure Dagster run loggers by @gtauzin.
- Rename `LoggerTranslator` to `LoggerCreator` for consistency with `ExecutorCreator` and `SchedulerCreator` by @gtauzin.
- Declare direct dependency on `pydantic>=1.0.0,<3.0.0` and enable version-agnostic Pydantic configuration by @gtauzin.
- Add conda-forge support for Kedro-Dagster, allowing installation with `conda` or `mamba` by @rxm7706 and @gtauzin.
- Allow setting `group_name` in a dataset's `metadata` to override the pipeline-derived group name; `group_name` is also applied per-AssetOut for multi-assets so each asset can have an individual group by @gtauzin.
- Add links to MLflow run in Dagster run logs, run tags, and materialized asset metadata by @gtauzin.

## Bug fixes and other changes
- Fix how `LoggerCreator` creates loggers for Dagster runs. Generic logging configuration is now supported from `dagster.yml` by @gtauzin.

## Breaking changes to the API

- Remove `dev` config in `dagster.yml` by @gtauzin.
